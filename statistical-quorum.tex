\section{Introduction}

Many democratic communities use voting to make collective decisions.
\todo{Should we support this statement with a reference?}
In its basic form voting consist of members of a community casting a vote \emph{in favor} or \emph{against} a decision and if
majority ($> 50\%$) of votes are in favor of the decision, the decision \emph{passes} and is adopted as a decision
of the whole community.

There have been many improvements proposed to this basic form and various analysis made.
\todo{Add references.}
In this paper we focus on the question of \emph{quorum} and how high the quorum should be.
Quorum is the minimum number of members participating in voting for voting to be seen as representative of the whole
community, i.e., legitimate.
If quorum is too low, decisions adopted might not represent the community.
If it is too high, the community might have issues achieving the quorum.
Not enough members might decide to participate in voting, or members might on purpose boycott voting to
prevent decision to be adopted, even if those opposing it are in minority.
Communities often decide quorum arbitrary\footnote{Robert's Rules of Order states that the quorum
``should approximate the largest number that can be depended on to attend any meeting except in very bad weather
or other extremely unfavorable conditions.''~\cite{roberts}}
and try to increase participation of members in communities' democratic processes through various means
to address the issue of too low turnout.
\todo{Add references. Mention forced participation in some countries.}
Moreover, many democratic communities have issues achieving quorum which hinders their operation.
\todo{Add references.}

Even if voting turnout has reached legally required quorum, or when one is not defined,
it is still a question how to evaluate if the turnout is high enough to find results legitimate.
As an example we can look at two recent votes, Brexit, a 2016 referendum for United Kingdom's withdrawal
from the European Union, and popular vote in 2016 USA presidential elections, as seen in Table~\ref{tab:example}.
Ignoring particularities of USA presidential elections process and using a popular vote as an example,
how can we reason about legitimacy of results?

\begin{table*}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{l r r r r r r r}
    {\small\textit{Vote}} & \multicolumn{2}{r}{\small \textit{First option}} & \multicolumn{2}{r}{\small \textit{Second option}} & {\small \textit{Total eligible voters}} & {\small \textit{Turnout}} & {\small \textit{Decision credibility}} \\
    \midrule
    Brexit & 17,410,742 & $51.9\%$ & 16,141,241 & $48.1\%$ & 46,500,001 & $72.2\%$ & $59.8\%$ \\
    Presidential elections & 62,984,825 & $48.9\%$ & 65,853,516 & $51.1\%$ & 230,585,915 & $55.9\%$ & $52.6\%$ \\
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Votes cast in Brexit, a 2016 referendum for United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union~\protect\cite{brexitresults},
  and 2016 USA presidential elections, popular vote~\protect\cite{usaresults1,usaresults2}. Simplified to only two options and without
  invalid votes. The last column shows computed decision credibility as described in Section \nameref{sec:statistical-quorum}. We see that
  credibility is low, which we can mostly attribute to the fact that there is small difference in votes between both options so
  with more votes any option could end up winning.}\label{tab:example}
\end{table*}

To answer this question we are proposing a novel metric, \emph{decision credibility}, which uses statistical
hypothesis testing to evaluate the credibility of the voting result.
It uses distribution of votes made to evaluate the probability of decision passing if everyone actually voted,
and not just those who voted.
Intuitively, if in a community of 100 members 40 members vote for a decision to pass and nobody against,
we can see that if everyone voted, the probability of majority of population voting for a decision is high.
On the other hand, if 41 members for in favor and 40 against, we cannot really say much about what would a decision
be if everyone voted.
Only two more votes against can completely change the outcome.
Hence, the suggested action would be for the community to gather more votes and continue discussion around the decision.
We describe decision credibility in more detail in Section \nameref{sec:statistical-quorum}.

Based on decision credibility we can define a \emph{statistical quorum} as a threshold which a decision's credibility
has to pass for a decision to be seen as legitimate.
For example, if we adopt $90\%$ as a reasonable requirement for statistical quorum and we compute decision
credibility for votes in Table~\ref{tab:example} we see that in both cases we do not reach statistical quorum
which puts legitimacy of those decisions into a question.
We discuss a way for a community to determine a reasonable statistical quorum in Section \nameref{sec:discussion}.

Traditionally it is argued that legitimacy comes from the fact that members had a chance to participate
and they decided not to, giving legitimacy to make a decision to those who did participate.
We argue that this is a problematic view because there are many restrictions on why members could not
participate and vote.
For example, they might not had time to participate because of other commitments, or motivation, or they might determined
that they are not informed enough to participate.
Moreover, members are from different reasons in their communities and potentially contribute in other ways
than by participating in its democratic processes.
Instead of assuming that everyone could participate if they would want, or trying to increase participation,
we can see amount of participation members are able to do as a limited resource, a \emph{collective attention}
a community has available to utilize for its decision making.

We can compute decision credibility during ongoing voting process to give feedback to the community
on how contentious a proposed decision is how much more votes are necessary for a statistical quorum
to be reached.
This allows the community to focus its collective attention towards decisions which require more votes
to determine a legitimate result, while reducing attention towards proposals which already have overwhelming support.
Instead of trying to increase participation on all democratic decisions being made, a community can
do that selectively through an automatic feedback loop, trying to reach statistical quorum for their decisions.

We built an open source web application PeerMind integrating statistical quorum with online voting.
The application exposes computed decision credibility to users in real-time and through that provides
the feedback loop needed for improving utilization of collective attention.
We present the application in Section \nameref{sec:peermind} and use it for evaluating statistical quorum in
Section \nameref{sec:evaluation}.

\section{PeerMind Web Application}
\label{sec:peermind}

%Range voting (also known as score voting) is voting where members of a community express their positions on open proposals by assigning
%each a score on a fixed scale, in the context of this paper, between $-1$ and $+1$.
%A proposal passes if the average score of all votes on a position is positive.
%When multiple competing proposals are being voted on, the one with highest average score wins.
%
%Prior work has shown that this approach generalizes many previous approaches to voting and allows members to express their
%positions in a highly informative and precise manner.
%We find it especially suitable for a web application because many web users are used to use it when ranking products
%and giving other ``five-star'' feedback.
%Moreover, if later on a new proposal is added to a set of existing proposals on which voting was already open, only the
%new proposal needs to be evaluated by members, as opposed to alternative voting systems where the relative rankings of
%each proposal would need reassessing (assuming members use a consistent personal scale when voting).

\todo[inline]{The app has features both for use in online and offline setting. This allows one to compute
statistical quorum also for an in-person meeting because math is now more complicated than just counting hands.
We focus on online experience in this paper.}

\todo[inline]{Security is out of the scope of this work. We assume here that users and their identities are known and are managed

\todo[inline]{Describe why is $0.90\%$ a reasonable statistical quorum and how to determine one for your community.}

\todo[inline]{Describe interesting example how we had a bug which were showing a very low statistical quorum for a failing
vote and so the whole community very engaged for a whole month to decide and resolve it. So how they trusted the
app and the metric and how it was really able to direct the attention of the community. It seems it works even if it is
buggy or not perfect, because it has worked so well in the past that members got used to the fact that when it was saying
that there is a consensus or not on an issue that that was also their own read of the community. So for the purpose of
directing attention the metric does not have to mathematically perfect.}

\todo[inline]{Security. How to prevent a group of people to vote and by trick reaching statistical quorum.
We use dynamic statistical quorum to address this, but one other approach is also for voting to stay open and
decisions can then be in the future revoked by people adding more votes, or changing them. But for some decisions
this might not really be possible, because decisions might not be reversible. You can revoke a law, but if you built
a building as a consequence of a decision?}

\section{Future Work}

\todo[inline]{More work on security evaluation of potential attacks when a community is using statistical quorum to force a decision.
Is there a game theoretical approach to it?}

\todo[inline]{How to surface information about credibility to users better than just a number? Visualizations? How can we help them
understand what exactly this is and how the math works?}

\section{Derivation of Decision Credibility}
\label{sec:derivation}

\todo[inline]{Derivation in order of dynamic credibility which is increasing through time, multiple competing options,
single option, because this is how they are easier to derive as each following is a special case of the previous one.}

%\todo[inline]{Unify terminology: population -> community, voters -> members, item -> decision, motion -> decision}

\subsection{Background}
A population of voters (a community) needs to collectively decide which item (if any) to take action on out of a set of competing items.
In order to democratically take action, the population needs to have a \{simple, super\}-majority of ``yes'' votes on a
winning item, while also demonstrating that the winning item is preferred over all other competing items.
We do not want to poll the entire population, but we do want to be certain (specifically, $99\%$ certain) that
the population does not take undesired actions, which in this case encompasses taking action on an item that is not
supported by a majority of the population and/or taking action on an item that is not clearly preferred over all
other competing alternatives.

\subsection{Problem Statement}
We wish to compute the probability that the bias in a population towards voting ``yes'' is greater than some
fraction of the population (e.g., $50\%$ for a simple majority, $67\%$ for a super majority).
In addition, we wish to compute the probability that the bias towards voting ``yes'' on a specific item is greater
than the bias towards voting ``yes'' on all other competing items.

\subsection{Assumptions}
We assume that there is a fixed underlying bias in the population that is to be estimated given raw voting data.

Without any votes, we assume that this bias may be any value between $0\%$ and $100\%$ with equal probability.

\subsection{Voting}
We allow for range voting where each member of the population may choose any real number in the range $[-1,+1]$ to
represent their vote, with $-1$ representing opposition and $+1$ representing support.
In the theory subsection below, we rescale votes to be in the range $[0,1]$ via the notation $\frac{votes + 1}{2}$.

We allow voters to ``abstain'' from voting.
We treat abstentions as indicating that a voter is removing themselves from the population of voters for an item.
It is important to distinguish an ``abstention'' (removing yourself from the voting population) from voting $0$
(indicating indifference).

\subsection{Bayesian Theory}

The commonplace and convenient choice of using the Beta distribution as our prior on the population bias is a
consequence of the Beta distribution's conjugacy with the binomial distribution, a distribution that arises
naturally when considering samples from a finite population.\footnote{To
properly understand the Bayesian approach to parameter estimation, read the following instructive tutorial:
\url{http://www.behind-the-enemy-lines.com/2008/01/are-you-bayesian-or-frequentist-or.html}
The tutorial is very similar to the problem we have at hand.}

After extracting the sufficient statistics from raw votes~---~namely the average score and the number of
abstentions~---~we can adjust the effective population size and corresponding threshold.
In addition, we can calculate the effective number of ``yes'' and ``no'' votes.\footnote{Which one can think
of as the number of Heads and Tails in the aforementioned tutorial.}

Let
\begin{description}
\begin{itemize}
\item[$C = $] $\{X_1,\ldots, X_n\}$, the set of competing motions,
\item[$N = $] population size,
\item[$X_i = $] $\{v_1, \ldots, v_{m_i}\}$, the $m_i$ raw votes for motion $X_i$, excluding ``abstentions'',
\item[$N_i = $] $(N - \textrm{number of abstentions on } X_i)$, the effective population voting on motion $X_i$,
\item[$\alpha_i = $] $\sum\limits_{v \in X_i} \left(\frac{v+1}{2}\right)$, the effective number of ``yes'' votes on motion $X_i$,
\item[$\beta_i = $] $m_i - \alpha_i$, the effective number of ``no'' votes on motion $X_i$,
\item[$K_i = $] $N_i - m_i$, the number of remaining votes yet to be cast on $X_i$,
\item[$p_i = $] true latent population bias towards voting ``yes'' on $X_i$.
\end{itemize}
\end{description}

When we have a single motion open for voting, $C=\{X_1\}$, we simply wish to compute:
\begin{align}\label{eq1}
\Pr(\alpha^*_1 > T_1 \mid X_1),
\end{align}
where
\begin{description}
\begin{itemize}
\item[$\alpha^*_i = $] the total number of ``yes'' votes for $X_i$ if we were to sample the entire population,
\item[$T_i = $] $f \cdot N_i$, for some fraction $f$ corresponding to the type of majority needed for the vote
(e.g. $f=\frac{1}{2}$ for a simple majority).
\end{itemize}
\end{description}
Using the prior $p_1 \mid X_1 \sim \operatorname{Beta}(1+\alpha_1,1+\beta_1)$, corresponding to a uniform prior when
no votes have been cast ($\alpha_1 = \beta_1 = 0$), we can express \eqref{eq1} as:
\begin{align*}
\Pr(\alpha^*_1 > T_1 \mid X_1) &= 1 - \Pr(\alpha^*_1 \leq T_1 \mid X_1),\\
\Pr(\alpha^*_1 \leq T_1 \mid X_1) &= \int_0^1 \Pr(\alpha^*_1 \leq T_1 \mid p_1)\cdot \Pr(p_1 \mid X_1) \mathrm{d}p_1\\
&= \int_0^1 \sum\limits_{i=0}^{V_1} {K_1 \choose i} p_1^{i} {(1-p_1)}^{K_1-i} \\
& \qquad\qquad\quad \times \operatorname{Beta}(p_1; 1+\alpha_1,1+\beta_1) \mathrm{d}p_1,
\end{align*}
where
\begin{description}
\begin{itemize}
\item[$V_i = $] $\lfloor{T_i - \alpha_i}\rfloor$, the maximum number of additional ``yes'' votes allowed such that
$X_i$ would remain below threshold.
\end{itemize}
\end{description}

Hence, we have
\begin{align}\label{eq2}
& \Pr(\alpha^*_1 > T_1 \mid X_1) = \nonumber\\
& 1 - \int_0^1 \sum\limits_{i=0}^{V_1} {K_1 \choose i} p_1^{i} {(1-p_1)}^{K_1-i} \cdot \operatorname{Beta}(p_1; 1+\alpha_1,1+\beta_1) \mathrm{d}p_1
\end{align}

In the scenario where $\mathbf{card}(C) = n > 1$, i.e., there are competing motions, there is additional complexity to
consider.
Without loss of generality, assume that $X_1$ is the most popular motion within $C$.
We now wish to not only compute \eqref{eq1}, but also the probability that $X_1$ is superior to all other
$X_i  \in C, i \neq 1$:

\begin{align}\label{eq3}
\Pr\left(\bigwedge_{i=2}^n (\alpha^*_1 > \alpha^*_i) \mid C\right)
\end{align}

Using the assumption
that votes on motions are independent across motions, which, in the common
scenario where there is a negative covariance between votes on competing
motions, will provide a lower bound on the probability, we can decompose \eqref{eq3} as follows:
\begin{align*}
& \Pr\left(\bigwedge_{i=2}^n (\alpha^*_1 > \alpha^*_i) \mid C\right)\\
=& \prod_{i=2}^n \Pr(\alpha^*_1 > \alpha^*_i \mid C)\\
=& \prod_{i=2}^n \iint\limits_{p_1, p_i} \Pr(\alpha^*_1 > \alpha^*_i \mid p_1, p_i) \cdot \Pr(p_1 \mid X_1) \cdot \Pr(p_i \mid X_i) \mathrm{d}p_i \mathrm{d}p_1\\
=& \prod_{i=2}^n \int_0^1 \int_0^1 \Pr(\alpha^*_1 > \alpha^*_i \mid p_1, p_i) \cdot \operatorname{Beta}(p_1; 1+\alpha_1,1+\beta_1) \\
& \qquad\qquad\qquad \times \operatorname{Beta}(p_i; 1+\alpha_i,1+\beta_i) \mathrm{d}p_i \mathrm{d}p_1\\
\end{align*}
Deriving an expression for $\Pr(\alpha^*_1 > \alpha^*_i \mid p_1, p_i)$, we get:
\begin{align*}
& \Pr(\alpha^*_1 > \alpha^*_i \mid p_1, p_i)\\
=& 1 - \Pr(\alpha^*_1 \leq \alpha^*_i \mid p_1, p_i)\\
=& 1 - \sum\limits_{m=0}^{K_1} \sum\limits_{n=\lceil{v_{1,i}+m}\rceil}^{K_i} {K_1 \choose m} p_1^{m} {(1-p_1)}^{K_1 - m} \cdot {K_i \choose n} p_i^{n} {(1-p_i)}^{K_i-n},
\end{align*}
where
\begin{description}
\begin{itemize}
\item[$v_{i,j} = $] $\alpha_i - \alpha_j$, the number of effective ``yes'' votes $X_i$ leads $X_j$ by.
\end{itemize}
\end{description}

Denoting
\begin{align}\label{eq4}
& \Phi_i(p_1,p_i) {\overset {\underset {\mathrm {def} }{}}{=}} \nonumber\\
& 1 - \sum\limits_{m=0}^{K_1} \sum\limits_{n=\lceil{v_{1,i}+m}\rceil}^{K_i} {K_1 \choose m} p_1^{m} {(1-p_1)}^{K_1 - m} \cdot {K_i \choose n} p_i^{n} {(1-p_i)}^{K_i-n},
\end{align}
we can simplify \eqref{eq3} to:
\begin{align}\label{eq5}
& \Pr\left(\bigwedge_{i=2}^n (\alpha^*_1 > \alpha^*_i) \mid C\right)\nonumber\\
&= \prod_{i=2}^n \int_0^1 \int_0^1 \Phi_i(p_1,p_i) \cdot \operatorname{Beta}(p_1; 1+\alpha_1,1+\beta_1) \nonumber\\
& \qquad\qquad\qquad \times \operatorname{Beta}(p_i; 1+\alpha_i,1+\beta_i) \mathrm{d}p_i \mathrm{d}p_1
\end{align}

We can numerically compute \eqref{eq2} and \eqref{eq5} given raw voting data.
In order to be certain before taking any actions, we would like for the computed credibilities to be $\geq 99\%$.

%\todo[inline]{Do we take into the account the distribution of votes? So if you have a very large standard deviation
%we might want to prefer a decision less than some other decision with smaller standard deviation, but maybe
%also smaller (but still positive) average. Is distribution of votes influencing dynamic quorum?}
